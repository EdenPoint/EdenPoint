What is Eden Point?

Eden Point (EPT) is a BEP-20 cryptocurrency based on the Binance Smart Chain. It is a coin with a permanently pre-allocated total of 1,000,000 tokens. These tokens are pre-generated, as the Eden Point team does not support the current Proof-of-Work model of mining and it's extremely negative environmental impact. EPT tokens are pre-minted, to be slowly released over time, with 500,000 tokens reserved for future potential airdrops and faucets. 

Our goal by the beginning of 2022 is to create a system where the owners of Eden Points can nominate an individual for a variety of reasons to be gifted a set number of Eden Points from the reserve pool. This will allow owners of Eden Points to vote for members of the public most worthy to be given Eden Points, as either a reward for reasons set by the nominators, or simply as a token of recognition based on the achievements of the individual.

This is a token meant to allow it's holders to recognize individuals for their goals or accomplishments in the crypto space and beyond. 
As we evolve, so will Eden Point; it's uses, and it's underlying values.

Development and Contributions

Development of Eden Point is complete and concrete. Based on a traditional BEP-20 contract format, the smart contract is final and will never fundamentally change. Once 100% of Eden Points are released and the reserved amount reaches 0%, the Eden Point team will post this information for public knowledge on it's webpage located at (https://edenpoint.org).
